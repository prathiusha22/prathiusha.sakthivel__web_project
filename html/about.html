          <h3>Supply Of Nutritious Greens</h3>
<br>
<br>
          <p>The food that we source from markets and grocery stores are usually grown with the help of chemical
            fertilizers. This chemical then seeps into your food system and can eventually lead to health hazards.
            Growing
            your own food will help you ensure the good quality of food that you consume on the daily basis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="benefit2">
          <h3>Ace Your Space</h3>
<br>
<br>
          <p>Building a terrace garden helps in keeping your home cool, it is great for the people living in tropical
            areas. All the plants growing on your terrace will create a micro-environment and will lower the
            temperature
            of the place. So while you enjoy the wholesome home-grown food you also save up on big bills from ACs.</p>

        <div class="benefit3">
          <h3>Reduces Your Carbon Footprint</h3>
<br>
<br>
          <p>By building a garden at your home you will help the environment and reduce your carbon footprint. The
            plants
            that you grow will improve air quality. Farming done using chemical materials deteriorates the soil
            quality
            and pollutes air and water.</p>

      <img class="soilimg" src="../assets/image/soil.jpeg" width="450px" height="250px" alt="img">
      <p class="soilpara">Healthy soil leads to healthy plants! Soil that is properly nourished and conditioned is the
        key to growing
        proper plants. Create your potting mixture by mixing soil<br> with organic compost. The ideal soil for your
        terrace
        garden should neither be too compacted nor too light. The soil should have a balanced texture, crumbly
        soil<br>
        that
        can retain the moisture is good for the plants.</p>
<br>

      <p class="soilpara">Feed your soil with organic compost regularly. The important nutrients can get washed away
        from your rooftop
        garden soil with the rains. Therefore, it is necessary to <br>fertilize them for a good yield. Avoid using
        chemical
        fertilizers as it will not only seep into your system but it will also harm the good bacterias and microbes in
        your soil.</p>
<br>

      <p class="soilpara">Prepare your potting mix by taking equal portions of red sand, organic compost, and coco
        peat.
        Mix it well and
        leave your potting mix to settle a week or two before<br> using it in containers. Ensure that the texture of
        your
        potting mixture is balanced. To keep your soil healthy, you can keep fertilizing it every now and then.<br>
        This
        in
        turn will keep your greens healthy. Here’s how to prepare organic fertilizers at home.</p>

      <p class="wateringpara">If you are planning to build soil patches and raised beds on your terrace then it’s
        important to start with
        waterproofing.<br> It will help you to prevent any potential damage to the building. Waterproofing can be
        easily
        done and the great thing<br> is that it’s only a one-time job.Waterproofing is an important step in the
        process
        of
        building a terrace garden. It’s like<br> laying the foundation of the building before you start constructing.
        Leakages and roof damage can get difficult to<br> manage for the people living in and around the building.
        Waterproofing can be done in various ways, one of the<br> effective ways to waterproof your roof is by the
        application of polymer coating on the concrete slab. Once the coating<br> is done, you can get started with
        your terrace garden.

        Pick your plants and<br> place them in the spots that receive ample sunlight.If your balcony is shady, you can

        and pick your plants accordingly.All salad greens like<br> arugula,
        lettuce, spinach, mustard, chard, kale, mizuna, komatsuna can do well in partial
